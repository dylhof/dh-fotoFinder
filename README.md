# Foto Finder
## Specification
This project is a display of our skills in javascript, css and html! The project includes a user input form which, when filled out and submitted, creates a card with a title, photo, and caption.  This photo card can then be favorited, filtered and deleted.  All changes made will be persistant upon reload of the page. So you know what that means! Local storage time!  So many great ways to show off the knowledge gained over the past five weeks!

## Learning Goals
Solidify and demonstrate your use of:
semantic HTML
clean & organized CSS styles
DRY JavaScript
localStorage to persist data
Iterate through/filter dom elements using for loops/array prototype methods
Understands the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
Ability to match/recreate a UI and create a great UX
